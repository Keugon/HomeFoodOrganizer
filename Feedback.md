# Structure

General structure of the project should be better. 
Try in folders between data objects (e.g. Betrag, Bewohner) and "Forms". 

## Improvement 1
Add a folder with `resources` (for e.g. hamburger_food_burger_fast-food_junk_food_icpon....). 

## Improvement 2 
Add a folder with `business-Objects` for `Betrag` , `Bewohner`

## Improvement 3
Rename `Bewohner` and `Betrag`. 

# Language

German language should not be used within programming, because of special characters. 
Normally you should stay within the english language, to increase readability of your code by the wider audiences. 

You want to attract potential employers with the Git repository at some point.
